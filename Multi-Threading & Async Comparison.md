# General Overview:

- Today we have processor in our PC's that has many cores that works togather to increase the performance of computations.
- Each core has many threads that runs the code and perform computations.
- When we write a program in Rust (or may be in any other language) that runs on the main thread which means that it'll execute the code line by line or more precisely command by command.
- To execute the next command code must wait for the running command to execute.
- Here comes the multi-threading concept.
